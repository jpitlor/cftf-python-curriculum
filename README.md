# CFTF Python Curriculum

At Camp Fitch Tech focus, we use Python for
teaching intro to programming courses, and we've 
created a curriculum for it for several reasons:

1. The kids that are in the course are typically
   younger and benefit from structure
2. Beginner concepts are usually very small
   and easy to learn from a computer. For example,
   think of how to teach if statements vs why mergesort is
   better than bubble sort
3. Having a pre-existing structure makes it easy to onboard
   new counselors that may not have advanced programming experience
4. Sticking to a mutually agreed upon curriculum ensures
   what we teach kids stays consistent and is in line with

# History 

The content of this course was started around 2016
by Tristrum Tuttle, improved upon by Ian Parker and
many other counselors that have at any point taught Python
at camp, adapted to Wiki slides by Charlie Hayes,
and finally adapted to a Jetbrains Edu Course by 
Jordan Pitlor.
