<h2>Running Code</h2>

<p>Congratulations, if you are reading this message, that means you successfully installed PyCharm. The next step is
    running code</p>

<p>On the left, you'll see a text editor with code. To the left of that, there's a darker region with line numbers. This
    is called the gutter. On line 1, in the gutter, you should see a green play button. Click it, and you should see a
    panel appear on the bottom - it will contain the output of whatever code just ran. Try it out, and mark this task as
    complete when you can run code.</p>
