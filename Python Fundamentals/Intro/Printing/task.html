<h1>Printing</h1>

<p>
    You can use the <code>print</code> function to print strings (characters surrounded in quotes), integers (counting
    numbers), and floats (numbers with decimals).
</p>
<p>
    A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Python has
    several useful built in functions like <code>print()</code>, <code>input()</code>, etcâ€¦ The item/items that go
    inside the parenthesis of the function are called "parameters."

    Try running this example!

<pre>
print("hello world")
print(12)
print(4.31)
</pre>
