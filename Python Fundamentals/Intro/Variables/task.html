    <h2>Variables</h2>

    <p>Variables in a computer program are analogous to "Buckets" or "Envelopes" where information can be for future
        use. Each variable is given a name kind of like a word written on the outside of the bucket. When referring to
        the variable, we use the name of the variable, not the data stored within. A variable in python is a set of
        characters not contained in quotation marks.
