    <h2>Variable Names</h2>

    <p>
        Sometimes we want to set a variable but make sure it stays unmodified. For example, we may have a variable
        called gravity to represent the acceleration due to gravity that we want to stay the same throughout our
        program. To remind ourselves not to modify the value, we give constants a name in ALL CAPITALS, in this case
        GRAVITY. This will come up in a later chapter when we define colors.

    <h3>Variable names must:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Start with a letter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Variable names MUST NOT:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Contain a space</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Variable names SHOULD:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>start with lower case (unless constant)</li>
        <li>use underscores between words</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Great variable names:</h3>
    <pre style="background: #f2f2f2; padding: 1rem">
first_name
distance
ds9 # Although it's not clear what this is referring to
</pre>

    <h3>Allowed but not proper:</h3>
    <pre style="background: #f2f2f2; padding: 1rem">
FirstName # starts with upper case; uses camelCase instead of underscore
firstName # Uses camelCase instead of underscore
X # starts with capital letter
</pre>

    <h3>Not allowed; won't compile:</h3>
    <pre style="background: #f2f2f2; padding: 1rem">
first name # contains space
9ds # starts with number
%correct # starts with symbol
</pre>
