<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>
    Any line that starts with the <code>#</code> character is a comment.
    Comments are not read as code and are skipped over when the program is run.
</p>

<p>
    If you run the code now, it will print the names of all three animals,
    dog, cat, and coyote. Insert some <code>#</code>s to make the first and
    third lines into comments. In other words, change the code so that it only
    prints "cat"
</p>

<div class="hint">
    <p>%IDE_NAME% makes it easy to turn existing code into comments!</p>
    <p>
        If there is one line you want to turn into a comment, put your cursor
        anywhere in the line and press <code>Ctrl+/</code> (<code>Cmd+/</code> on macOS)
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are trying to make multiple lines into a comment, click and
        drag to select those lines, and use the same shortcut. The first and
        last lines only need at least one character selected. They don't have
        to be entirely selected.
